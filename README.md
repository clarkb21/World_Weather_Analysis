# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose
- The purpose of the project is to improve the PlanMYTrip app to allow users to input preferences of weather and filter out places around the world that have those desired temperatures. 
- The app would then locate the nearest hotel to their desired city, and using heat maps and pop up markers, would display information about the hotel and city, including maximum temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a current weather description.

## Project Overview
- The project uses an Application Programming Interface (API) to request information from websites to display on the app or in the data frame. 
- The primary tools used during the project are Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, the Citipy module, and API keys from multiple websites.


### Challenge Overview
- The challenge part of the project has three main components: 
  1. Retrieving weather data using an API
  2. Creating a customer travel destinations map
  3. Creating a travel itinerary map using the Google Directions API

## Resources
- Data Source: Open Weather Map API; Google Maps Places and Directions API
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Conda 4.13.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8, Pandas 1.4.3
- MSU Bootcamp Spot Module 6: https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/2508/pages/6-dot-0-1-using-apis-to-visualize-weather-data?module_item_id=635195

## Results
- Heatmaps created a visual for users to identify the most preferred destinations. 
- Pop up markers created another visual with valuable information to allow users to make the most informed decisions about their vacations.
- Travel routes could also be requested in the app using the Google Directions API and inputing desired cities.
